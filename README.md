## üöÄ Getting Started

To run Fast Food Manager from the source code, follow these steps:

**Prerequisites:**
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)
* Git

**Installation & Setup:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/thebeardydeveloper/fast-food-manager.git](https://github.com/thebeardydeveloper/fast-food-manager.git)
    cd fast-food-manager
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Build Tailwind CSS:**
    The application uses Tailwind CSS, which needs to be compiled.
    * For a one-time production build:
        ```bash
        npm run build:css:prod
        ```
    * For development (watches for changes and rebuilds automatically - run in a separate terminal):
        ```bash
        npm run build:css
        ```

4.  **Run the application in development mode:**
    This command typically also runs the CSS build script if not already running.
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    Or, if you have a specific development script that assumes CSS is being watched separately:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    To open Developer Tools, uncomment the line `mainWindow.webContents.openDevTools();` in `main.js`.
